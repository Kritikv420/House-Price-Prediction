This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for a house price prediction project. The project walks through an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, including:

Loading and cleaning the dataset using Pandas.

Handling missing values and performing one-hot encoding for categorical features.

Scaling features using StandardScaler.

Training a LinearRegression model to predict sale prices.

Evaluating the model with metrics like MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² score.
